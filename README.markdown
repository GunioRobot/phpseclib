I forked this from http://phpseclib.sourceforge.net mainly because I
was having trouble with the code, and wanted to add error handling /
logging / whatever.

This fork will be PHP v5 only. I understand that some of the target
users of phpseclib are people on shared hosting that is too backward
to have updated to PHP v5, but trying to maintain backward
compatibility for these folks is a waste of time in my opinion. There
are loads of shared hosting companies supporting PHP 5 now.
